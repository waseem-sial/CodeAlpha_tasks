# CodeAlpha_Tasks_ML1

This repository contains two machine learning projects:

## 1. Face Recognition Project

### Overview

This project detects and recognizes faces in images using OpenCV and TensorFlow. It demonstrates practical applications of machine learning in facial recognition.

### Project Structure

  i. **data/**  
  - **known_faces/**: Images of known faces for recognition.
  - **unknown_faces/**: Images for testing face recognition.

  ii. **src/**
  - **face_recognition.py**: Script for face detection and recognition.

  iii. **requirements.txt**
  - Lists dependencies for the project.


### Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- TensorFlow

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   https://github.com/waseem-sial/CodeAlpha_tasks_ML1.git

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**

    ```bash
    cd face-recognition-project
    
3. **Install Dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
  ### Usage

1. **Add images to data/known_faces/ and data/unknown_faces/.**

2. **Run the script:**

    ```bash
    python src/face_recognition.py
3. **Review the results in the console or output files.**

## 2. Music Recommendation System

### Overview
This project provides personalized song recommendations based on user listening history. It predicts the likelihood of repeated plays using a dataset of user song histories and timestamps.

### Project Structure

  i. **data/**
  - **data_set.csv**: Dataset for generating recommendations.

### Requirements
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- scikit-learn
  
### Installation
1. **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    https://github.com/waseem-sial/CodeAlpha_tasks_ML1.git
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**

    ```bash
    cd music-recommendation-system
3. **Install Dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt

### Usage
1. **Ensure data/data_set.csv is in place.**

2. **Run the script:**

    ```bash
    python src/recommendation_system.py
3. **Check the generated recommendations in the console or output files.**
